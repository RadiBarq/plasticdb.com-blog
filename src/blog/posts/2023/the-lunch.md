Since the launch of the iPhone, I have constantly pondered the next groundbreaking technology that would revolutionize people's lives, much like smartphones, cars, and computers did. However, finding a clear answer has not been easy, given the myriad of trends and technologies that have emerged in recent years, from crypto and blockchain to AR and VR. While these technologies hold value, they have not proven to be revolutionary or significantly life-changing—at least not until recently.

I recall stumbling upon a Twitter post showcasing a screenshot of a fascinating smart chatbot. Initially, I dismissed it as just another chatbot, but the following day, my Twitter feed was inundated with similar screenshots and conversations. As I delved deeper, particularly into discussions related to programming, I could hardly believe my eyes. It became abundantly clear to me at that moment that this was a revolutionary technology that had taken the world by surprise.

To be honest, I never anticipated that the next revolutionary breakthrough would be related to AI. During my time studying Computer Engineering at university, I didn't have a strong inclination toward AI courses. Perhaps it was because they involved more math and calculations and less programming. Additionally, I believed AI was still in its early stages, requiring ample time to mature and become truly useful. While I acknowledged the value of neural networks and machine learning, and their potential to replicate the architecture of the human brain, I felt that it would take an eternity of research and development. Consequently, I chose to focus my attention on other fields, such as blockchain and app development.

Since the introduction of ChatGPT, my mind has been preoccupied with exploring the diverse applications of this technology beyond mere question-answering. I closely followed the news and observed the emergence of startups and products harnessing the power of Language Models (LLMs). It became evident to me that LLMs could be leveraged across various fields, spanning from programming and customer support to writing and image generation. However, there was one particular area that intrigued me—the realm of search.

I am thrilled to introduce PlasticDB, a groundbreaking initiative driven by our vision to democratize data accessibility using LLMs. Regardless of your technical proficiency, we aim to empower everyone with the ability to query SQL databases using natural language. This marks just the initial step in our ambitious journey to simplify search functionality across a wide range of use cases.

From SQL databases to non-SQL databases, Excel files to Jira tickets, we recognize that the task of searching and retrieving information has never been straightforward. However, with the remarkable advancements in AI, we have the privilege of pioneering solutions that will revolutionize the search landscape. Our team is excited to embark on this transformative journey, paving the way for a future where search becomes effortless and accessible to all.
